MisÃ¨re/Reverse Tic-Tac-Toe:

Game board: 
|----> A 3x3 square grid.

Turn Order: 
|----> The system randomly determines which player (X or O) goes first.

Turns: 
|----> Players take turns placing their respective shapes (X or O) on any empty cell of the grid.

Losing Condition: 
|----> The first player to place 3 of their shapes in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row loses the game (giving the win to the other player).
